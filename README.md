# Introduction

As climate change increases in severity, so does the occurrence of natural disasters (Vernick, 2025). In the Canadian context, due to high amounts of fuel from forests and landscapes, we are at increasing risk of wildfire. As recently as 2023, British Columbia experienced its worst fire year on record (“2023 Is Now Officially the Most Expensive, Most Destructive Wildfire Season on Record in B.C.,” 2023). 

To improve wildfire predictions, we can use climate indicators to assess upcoming wildfire seasons. Our study focuses on British Columbia, a region with diverse climate zones. In this project, we analyze snow depth patterns and their correlation with wildfire density. Snow accumulation, measured in centimeters, can impact soil moisture, vegetation growth, and fuel availability, all of which influence wildfire potential (Westerling et al., 2006). 

This tutorial explores the hypothesis that higher snow depth in winter leads to lower wildfire density in the following summer. Research suggests that increased snow accumulation delays the onset of spring, shortening the fire season (Holden et al., 2018). Conversely, in years with less snow accumulation, an early spring can lead to drier vegetation and increased wildfire risk (Holden et al., 2018).

Using R, we will conduct various statistical and spatial analyses to assess this relationship. By the end of this tutorial, users will be able to perform:
- Data cleaning and aggregation
- Descriptive and inferential statistics
- Point pattern analysis
- Spatial autocorrelation & interpolation
- Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)

Throughout this process, users will generate maps, tables, and charts to visualize findings and contribute to wildfire risk assessment efforts.
